# Flashy Delay Trigger Project

Welcome to the Flashy Delay Trigger project! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up your Arduino Nano with the provided code and hardware.

## Prerequisites

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **Breadboard**
3. **Jumper Wires**
4. **Components listed in the schematic**
5. **Computer with Internet access**

## Step 1: Install Arduino IDE

1. Go to the [Arduino Software Page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
2. Download the Arduino IDE for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Install the Arduino IDE by following the on-screen instructions.

## Step 2: Download the Project Code

1. Visit the project repository: [FlashyDelayTrigger](https://github.com/DatBlaueHus/FlashyDelayTrigger/tree/master).
2. Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the ZIP file to a convenient location on your computer.

## Step 3: Open the Project in Arduino IDE

1. Launch the Arduino IDE.
2. Click on `File > Open`.
3. Navigate to the extracted project folder and open the `.ino` file inside.

## Step 4: Set Up the Hardware

1. Refer to the schematic in the `board` subdirectory of the project folder.
2. Assemble the components on the breadboard as shown in the schematic.
3. Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.

## Step 5: Upload the Code to Arduino Nano

1. In the Arduino IDE, select your board and port:
    - Go to `Tools > Board` and select `Arduino Nano`.
    - Go to `Tools > Port` and select the correct port for your Arduino Nano.
2. Click on the `Upload` button (right arrow icon) to upload the code to your Arduino Nano.
3. Wait for the upload to complete. The message "Done uploading" will appear in the status bar.

## Step 6: Test Your Setup

1. Once the upload is complete, the Arduino Nano will start running the uploaded code.
2. Observe the behavior of your setup and ensure it matches the expected results as per the project description.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up the Flashy Delay Trigger project on your Arduino Nano.
