# Known Issues

This is a list of quirks I'm still working on

# Hardware
This works if you keep the SSD1306 configured with a height of 32, which you also do with a 128 x 64 display.
Setting height to 64 gets you barely over the splash screen. In all the following screens, text rendering is not done at all.


## UI
* Info text triggererd some times too early
* long Info texts should not aligned vertically

## Functionality
* flash triggering should happen due to sudden increase of level, not from a bas level
